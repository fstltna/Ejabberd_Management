# eJabberd Management Console (1.0.0)
Allows you to manage your eJabberd server process with a text based UI

---

Install all the dependancies by running this command:

- ./installdeps

Run "ejmc". If you need to change any settings after this, edit "~/.ejmcrc" and make the desired changes. This can be done within ejmc itself.

You also need to have my eJabberd Backup Script installed.
